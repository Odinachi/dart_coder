# async/await

Imagine you want to eat **ice cream** 🍦.

But the ice cream truck 🚚 isn’t here yet — it's on the way.

You don’t just sit there doing nothing… You keep playing ⚽ until the truck shows up.
When it finally comes, you run to it and get your treat!

👉 In Dart, this is what `async/await` helps you do:

> It lets you **wait** for something to finish (like the ice cream arriving) **without freezing** everything else.

---

## 🍦 Real-Life Example: Waiting for Ice Cream

```dart
Future<String> getIceCream() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2)); // Wait for 2 seconds
  return '🍦 Ice cream is here!';
}
```

> `Future.delayed` means: "Pretend something takes time — like waiting."

---

## 🕹️ Let's Use It!

```dart
void main() async {
  print('Playing outside...');

  String iceCream = await getIceCream();

  print(iceCream);
  print('Now eating ice cream! 😋');
}
```

### 🧠 Output:

```
Playing outside...
🍦 Ice cream is here!
Now eating ice cream! 😋
```

Even though you had to wait, Dart didn't freeze. You kept doing fun stuff while waiting.

## ⏳ Why Use `async/await`?

Some things take time:

* Downloading a file 📥
* Waiting for a friend’s reply 📲
* Getting ice cream from the truck 🍦

You don’t want your app to freeze ❄️ during the wait.
You want it to **keep going**, then handle the thing **when it’s ready**!

## 🧠 Understanding the Pieces

| Word     | What It Means                                     |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `async`  | Says “This function might take some time” 🕰️     |
| `await`  | Says “Wait for this to finish before moving on” ⏳ |
| `Future` | A promise to give you something **later** 🤝      |

## 🔧 More Complete Example

```dart
Future<void> doHomework() async {
  print('Starting homework...');
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  print('Homework done! 📚');
}

Future<void> cleanRoom() async {
  print('Cleaning room...');
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  print('Room is clean! 🧹');
}

void main() async {
  await doHomework();
  await cleanRoom();
  print('Now I can play! 🎮');
}
```

### 🧠 Output:

```
Starting homework...
Homework done! 📚
Cleaning room...
Room is clean! 🧹
Now I can play! 🎮
```

> Everything happens in order — just like your checklist!

## 🎉 So remember:

* **`async`** = “This might take time”
* **`await`** = “Hold on, I’m waiting…”
* It helps your program **stay smooth** 🧈 instead of getting stuck!
